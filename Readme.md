# Rethinking

An App that helps the user make a habit of doing reflection, with an intriguing question that sparks thinking and contemplating.

first time with Swift, this app was done for my first nano challenge at Apple Developer Academy. in the first week, we need to make a single view app. then for next week, we improve it based on the feedback of our peer on Academy. for that, I change the single view app and have a multiple view app. some of the features are UserDefault for permanently save the text that the user writes and adding background sound.
